### 🚀 Features & Capabilities  

#### ✅ **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
- Designed a **RAG pipeline** using **LangChain, Cohere APIs, and FAISS** for **efficient document retrieval** from vast unstructured datasets.  
- Ensured responses were **contextually relevant** by dynamically fetching and processing the most pertinent documents before generating answers.  
- Optimized **retrieval speed and accuracy**, making the system suitable for large-scale applications.  

#### ✅ **Knowledge Graph-Based Question Answering**  
- Built a **Knowledge Graph QA system** utilizing **Neo4j, LangChain, and Mixtral APIs** to structure and extract relationships from unstructured data.  
- Enabled **semantic querying** over structured knowledge, improving information retrieval beyond standard text search methods.  
- Integrated **graph-based reasoning** to generate insightful answers by leveraging entity relationships within the dataset.
